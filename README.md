## About the Video Course
Make no mistake, Ethereum and Blockchain technology is disrupting the web as we know it. The tech industry cannot hire blockchain developers fast enough and there are only a small number of resources for new developers.

In this course, you’ll start by learning the Ethereum smart contract programming language Solidity and its capabilities. You’ll design, test, and deploy secure Ethereum smart contracts using the latest industry standards. Also, you’ll build dynamic front ends for web applications and configure your project infrastructure with smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain.

By the end of the course, you’ll have comprehensive knowledge in writing smart contracts and building applications that interact with them.
